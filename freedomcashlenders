Credit score: Perfect credit isn’t required to qualify for funding. However, the best loan terms are typically reserved for borrowers with good or excellent credit – 690 or higher. If you have a lower credit score, expect higher interest rates and fees.
Income: Some lenders request proof of steady and verifiable income, such as a recent pay stub, W-2 or tax return, along with your employer’s contact information. If you’re unemployed but earn income from self-employment, side hustles, child support, alimony or government benefits, be sure to disclose it on your loan application.
Debt-to-income (DTI) ratio: A reasonable DTI is required for loan approval. It’s calculated by dividing the sum of your monthly debt payments by your total monthly gross income. Aim for a DTI below 50 percent to have the best chance of getting approved for a personal loan with low income.
